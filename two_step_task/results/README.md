Place fitted results here. The `run_fit.py` script writes per-participant CSVs to `two_step_task/results/fitted_parameters/` by default.

Recommended raw data location:
- Put the Hartley two-step CSV at `data/raw/hartley_twostep_data.csv` (repo root `data/raw` folder).

Processed per-participant pickles will be written to:
- `two_step_task/data/processed/participant_<id>.pkl` (if you add saving later).
